## Observability improvements

---

### Before 3.3

Migration might be necessary moving from 3.2 to 3.3 due to Micrometer version and prometheus client version bumps

---

### But / Because

Micrometer internally has upgarded to the API stable 1.x version of the Prometheus Java Client moving away from the 0.x line.

---

### Therefore

---

Micrometer 1.13 has deprecated its Jersey support in favor of Jerseyâ€™s jersey-micrometer module. 

---

Use of the Prometheus Push Gateway is not supported with the 1.x client, until this support has been added from the Prometheus maintainers.

---

Observations can now be enabled for the simple, direct and stream listener and on the RabbitTemplate via properties.

---

Support for the Micrometer `@SpanTag` annotation has been added.

---

Added support for tagged fields for both Brave and OpenTelemetry. Support for local fields has been added for Brave.

---

Enable ProcessInfoContributor

```conf
management.info.process.enabled=true
```

Process info will be added to the `/actuator/info` endpoint

```json
{
  "process": {
    "pid": 24199,
    "parentPid": 3352,
    "owner": "codespace",
    "cpus": 2
  },    
  "java": {
    "version": "21.0.3",
    "vendor": {
      "name": "Microsoft",
      "version": "Microsoft-9388422"
    },
    "runtime": {
      "name": "OpenJDK Runtime Environment",
      "version": "21.0.3+9-LTS"
    },
    "jvm": {
      "name": "OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM",
      "vendor": "Microsoft",
      "version": "21.0.3+9-LTS"
    }
  },
  "os": {
    "name": "Linux",
    "version": "6.5.0-1021-azure",
    "arch": "amd64"
  }
}
```

If no application name is explicitly set, `unknown_service` is now used for OpenTelemetry. This aligns the Spring Boot default to the OpenTelemetry specification.
